Developed/Built/Deployed with NextJS/Vercel, Tailwind, Spotify API, Framer Motion, Figma, and Typescript.

~Completely designed by DFBDev (besides the Spotify API, which is solely the property of SpotifyAB™. I own absolutely nothing manufactured by SpotifyAB™, I am responsible for the design (disregarding the SpotifyAB™ logo) and project source code only)~
